# Hopscotch iOS Test Project

## Instructions:
In this project you will be creating a simplified version of the Hopscotch projects feed.This app should pull data from our server at `https://hopscotch-ios-test.herokuapp.com/projects` and display it in a view that scrolls.

We included Cocoapods in the project if you need to import and external libraries but this is not required. 

The design for the feed is included in the file `Hopscotch-iOS-Test.pdf`. All the measurements/colors/fonts are included in the project folder entitled `UI Helpers`.

Bonus points for loading data and images asynchronously. 

Please document any assumptions you make. 

Jacqueline Schweiger Assumptions:

- Written in Swift
- PDF shows iPad Pro (9.7 in) in horizontal view
- Scrolls vertically
- Objects instantiated with screenshot, author, and title properties
- Asynchronous loading of data and images with SDWebImage pod
- Assume JSON data returns as [[String: Any]] and screenshot, author, and title values as type String
-
